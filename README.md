SCSU Buley Library Services Bibliography Project

Members: Norman Benedict, Tucker Doyle, Daniel Ramirez

Description

This project was created to assist Library Services in automating processes they 
have to do manually, which were creating a script to retrieve Scopus entries with 
affiliation to the University and a web form that works in populating the Zotero 
database with user info.
